Receiving main stage play on both weekends from Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Hardwell, Nicky Romero & Martin Garrix, to name a few “Like That” quickly became an internet hype and topped the 1001 Tracklist “most heard” list from the festival. The track, today officially premiered via the below soundcloud link, features a signature high energy Bassjackers drop that is best suited for exactly that stage \n\n2014 was already a huge highlight reel for Marlon Flohr & Ralph van Hilst - collectively known as Bassjackers. It started out with the monstrous track “Crackin’ “ (Martin Garrix edit) which topped all the club play charts for much of January & February and is still played by many major name artists. This was soon followed by a collab with LA based DJ MAKJ and the track “DERP” which went on to chart officially in the US Billbaord Dance top 20. The summer also saw a collab release on Revealed with up coming DJ Kenneth G, “RAMPAGE” which was first debuted during Hardwell’s closing set @ Ultra 2014. \n",
