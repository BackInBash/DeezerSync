    "description": "A few months ago NGHTMRE reached out to me and asked if I'd be willing to remix his song 'Frontlines' with Zeds Dead.  I was hesitant, as I really liked the original and I'm a firm believer in leaving great songs as they are.  However, I told myself that I would do my best to *change* the nature of the song, rather than try to better it.  My goal was to produce a piece with a lot of emotion as well as energy - something that would make you happy as well as get you going.  I think this remix nails that concept, and I'm super excited to share it with you all! ⚙\n\nsoundcloud.com/crankdatmusic\nfacebook.com/crankdat\ntwitter.com/crankdat\ninstagram.com/crankdat",
