Onto my next project! I'm really grateful to Alex & Drew AKA The Chainsmokers for letting me remix this song as it's probably my favorite vocal from the album. I really hope you guys like it and play it out and like and repost it!\n\nThanks for being such great fans,\nAlberto\n\nFACEBOOK.COM/TRIARCHY\nINSTAGRAM.COM/TRIARCHYMUSIC\n@TRIARCHY\nYOUTUBE.COM/TRIARCHYMUSIC\nSNAPCHAT: @TRIARCHY\nSPOTIFY: open.spotify.com/artist/6Rgu58S7N7LtkLI3zhnY9j",
