It has this dope 'ay ay ay ahhh' vocal chant in the chorus!\" Right away, we thought about how awesome it would be to remix it. Then about a week later, our manager emailed us the track (without knowing how much we liked it) and asked us if we wanted to take a stab at it. No brainer.\n\nAnyways, we had so much fun making this remix! We made a crazy vocal chop in the drop, I played a little guitar, and it was our first time working with a rap. Hope you guys like it, and if you do, PLEASE give it a heart on HypeM. Thanks!\n\nFACEBOOK:\nwww.facebook.com/youngbombsmusic\n\nINSTAGRAM:\nwww.instagram.com/youngbombs\n\nTWITTER:\nwww.twitter.com/youngbombs",
