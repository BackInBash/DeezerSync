    "description": "\"Ben and I have been talking about collabing forever, and agreed that when we did it had to be the perfect representation of G-House, in its highest form. A couple months ago Ben came to me with the idea of working with the vocals from \"Hello\", and I knew immediately that this was the perfect concept for our collab. I'm so happy with how the track turned out, it's been destroying in my sets lately and think we accomplished exactly we set out to do... hopefully we get some fuckin' thanks for it.\" - Dr. Fresch\n\n\"This collab with Tony has been a long time coming, and we both agreed when the right idea came along we had to execute it precisely. Both with a west coast influence in music we knew the Hello Vocals would settle nicely into a proper G-House track. I couldn't be happier with the final outcome of this record as its my proudest final cut to date.\" - Bijou\n\n@drfresch\nwww.facebook.com/Dr.Fresch\nwww.twitter.com/DrFresch\n\n@djbijou\nwww.facebook.com/OfficialDJBijou\nwww.twitter.com/BijouOfficial1",
