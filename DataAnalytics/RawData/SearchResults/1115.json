    "description": "We whispered promises \nIn the chill of dawn \nWe traded secrets \nAs our shadows watched \n\nYou erased my\nTransparent \nTransparent sins \nYou made me feel\nAlive \nAlive again \n\nAnd now I'm trying to recall \nWhy I wait here in the rainfall\nI'm trying to recall\nWhy I wait here in the rainfall\n\nAs your hands let go of me\nI clung to places you might be \nAs your hands let go of me \n\nI still search for you\nIn the moonlight \nI see your fragments \nIn the outlines \n\nIlluminate my \nTransparent \nTransparent sins \n\nTruth surrounds me \nAnd I find \nI'm lost again \n\nAnd now I'm trying to recall why I wait here in the rainfall\nI'm trying to recall why I wait here in the rainfall\n\nRetrace your footsteps\nRetrace your mind\nRetrace your footsteps",
