    "description": "\"I've been in love with Destructo's 'Techno' since the first time I heard it - I think midtempo electro and deeper indie dance are taking off, and I wanted to give the original my own rework. I liked how Destructo grabbed the sample from Eminem's 'Without Me', and decided to use more of that sample to build the song around. I kept the tempo at 112BPM, but decided to get more complex and weird with my bass arrangement - I hope my Fresch Fam love this remix as much as I do!\"\n\n@destructohard\nhttps://www.facebook.com/destructohard\nhttps://www.twitter.com/destructohard\nhttps://www.instagram.com/destructohard/\n\n@drfresch\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Dr.Fresch\nhttps://www.twitter.com/DrFresch\nhttps://www.instagram.com/drfresch",
