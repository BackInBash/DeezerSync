    "description": "Was an honor to remix Jai Wolf's iconic song Indian Summer. Was challenging to make it my own cause I felt that the song was very much what it was supposed to be already. Ended up doing a few remixes, all of which were very similar to the original, but finally I decided that I had to do something completely different, which became the final product. Super proud.
